# Welcome 
Welcome to the GitHub home page for [*Si2ren*](https://en.investigationbyimage.com/developpement): an IBM i2 connector developed by [Satom IT & Learning solutions](https://satom.net/en/) that transforms from the [Siren Platform](https://siren.io/) to i2 Analyst's Notebook Premium through i2 Connect gateway of i2 Analyze.

## Si2ren: Example code
This example is built over [Siren's demo data](https://docs.siren.io/siren-platform-user-guide/11.0/getting-started/getting-started-with-demo-data.html) as in the [Siren tutorial](https://siren.io/getting-started/). In our example, four dashboards are created: *articles*, *companies*, *investments* and *investors*.

The Si2ren-example returns the listes of all dashboards in the Siren Platform. It can perform different seeded searches of dashboards. In paritcular, we have configured level-1(search in *companies*) and level-2 seeded search( search for investors of given companies) thanks to Siren Platform's Data Model.
